# PointRef

`PointRef` objects keep a specific point in a document synced over time as new operations are applied to the editor. You can access their property `current` at any time for the up-to-date `Point` value.

```typescript
interface PointRef {
  current: Point | null
  affinity: 'forward' | 'backward' | null
  unref(): Point | null
}
```
