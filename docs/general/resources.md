# Resources

A few resources that are helpful for building with Slate.

## Libraries

* [`is-hotkey`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/is-hotkey) is a simple way to check whether an `onKeyDown` handler should fire for a given hotkey, handling cross-platform concerns like cmd vs. ctrl keys for you automatically.
* [`react-broadcast`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-broadcast) works well when you need to have your custom node components re-render based on state that lives outside the `document`. It's the same pattern that `react-router` uses to update `<Link>` components.

## Tooling

* [Immutable.js Console Extension](https://github.com/mattzeunert/immutable-object-formatter-extension) — this greatly improves the `console.log` output when working with [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) objects, which Slate's data model is based on.

## Showcase

* [ORY Editor](https://editor.ory.am/) — a self-contained, inline WYSIWYG editor library built on top of Slate.
* [Nossas Editor](http://slate-editor.bonde.org/) — a drop-in WYSIWYG editor built with Slate.
* [french-press-editor](https://github.com/roast-cms/french-press-editor) – a well-balanced, customizeable editor component with offline support; built with Slate.
