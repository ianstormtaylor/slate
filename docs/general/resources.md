# Resources

A few resources that are helpful for building with Slate.

## Libraries

These libraries are helpful when developing with Slate:

- [`is-hotkey`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/is-hotkey) is a simple way to check whether an `onKeyDown` handler should fire for a given hotkey, handling cross-platform concerns like <kbd>cmd</kbd> vs. <kbd>ctrl</kbd> keys for you automatically.
