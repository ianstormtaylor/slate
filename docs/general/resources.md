# Resources

A few resources that are helpful for building with Slate.

## Libraries

These libraries are helpful when developing with Slate:

- [`is-hotkey`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/is-hotkey) is a simple way to check whether an `onKeyDown` handler should fire for a given hotkey, handling cross-platform concerns like cmd vs. ctrl keys for you automatically.

## Extensions and Plugins

These extensions and plugins add additional features and capabilities to Slate:

- [Plate](https://github.com/udecode/plate) Rich text editor plugin system for Slate & React
- [`slate-angular`](https://github.com/worktile/slate-angular) Angular-based view layer, which is a useful supplement to Slate for building a rich text editor using Angular.
- [`slate-yjs`](https://github.com/BitPhinix/slate-yjs/) Collaborative editing utilities for Slate leveraging Yjs
- [`slate-collaborative`](https://github.com/cudr/slate-collaborative) Collaborative editing utilities for Slate leveraging Automerge
