# Resources

A few resources that are helpful when using Slate.


## Tooling

- [Immutable.js Console Extension](https://github.com/mattzeunert/immutable-object-formatter-extension) — this greatly improves the `console.log` output when working with [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) objects, which Slate's data model is based on.


## Showcase

- [ORY Editor](https://editor.ory.am/) — a self-contained, inline WYSIWYG editor library built on top of Slate.
- [Reboo Editor](http://slate-editor.bonde.org/) — a drop-in WYSIWYG editor built with Slate.
