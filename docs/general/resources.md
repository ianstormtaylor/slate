# Resources

A few resources that are helpful for building with Slate.

## Libraries

These libraries are helpful when developing with Slate:

- [`is-hotkey`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/is-hotkey) is a simple way to check whether an `onKeyDown` handler should fire for a given hotkey, handling cross-platform concerns like cmd vs. ctrl keys for you automatically.

- [Plate](https://github.com/udecode/plate) Rich text editor plugin system for Slate & React
- [`slate-angular`](https://github.com/worktile/slate-angular) Angular-based view layer, which is a useful supplement to Slate for building a rich text editor using Angular.
