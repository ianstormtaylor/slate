# Commands

The core `Editor` ships with a bunch of built-in commands that provide common behaviors for rich text editors.

## Current Selection Commands

These commands act on the `document` based on the current `selection`. They are equivalent to calling the [Document Range Commands](#document-range-commands) with the current selection as the `range` argument, but they are there for convenience, since you often want to act with the current selection, as a user would.

### `addMark`

`addMark(mark: Mark) => Editor` <br/>
`addMark(properties: Object) => Editor` <br/>
`addMark(type: String) => Editor`

Add a [`mark`](./mark.md) to the characters in the current selection. For convenience, you can pass a `type` string or `properties` object to implicitly create a [`Mark`](./mark.md) of that type.

### `delete`

`delete() => Editor`

Delete everything in the current selection.

### `insertBlock`

`insertBlock(block: Block) => Editor` <br/>
`insertBlock(properties: Object) => Editor` <br/>
`insertBlock(type: String) => Editor`

### `deleteBackward`

`deleteBackward(n: Number) => Editor`

### `deleteForward`

`deleteForward(n: Number) => Editor`

Delete forward `n` characters at the current cursor. If the selection is expanded, this method is equivalent to a regular [`delete()`](#delete). `n` defaults to `1`.

## History Commands

These commands use the history to undo/redo previously made changes.

### `redo`

`redo() => Editor`

Move forward one step in the history.

### `undo`

`undo() => Editor`

Move backward one step in the history.

### `snapshotSelection`

`snapshotSelection() => Editor`

Snapshot `value.selection` for `undo` purposes, useful with delete operations like `editor.removeNodeByKey(focusBlock.key).undo()`.

## Miscellaneous Commands

### `normalize`

`normalize() => Editor`

This method normalizes the document with the value's schema. This should run automatically-you should not need to call this method unless you have manually disabled normalization (and you should rarely, if ever, need to manually disable normalization). The vast majority of changes, whether by the user or invoked programmatically, will run `normalize` by default to ensure the document is always in adherence to its schema.

> 🤖 If you must use this method, use it sparingly and strategically. Calling this method can be very expensive as it will run normalization on all of the nodes in your document.

### `withoutNormalizing`

`withoutNormalizing(fn: Function) => Editor`

This method calls the provided function with the current instance of the `Change` object as the first argument. Normalization does not occur while the fuction is executing, and is instead deferred to be be run immediately after it completes.

This method can be used to allow a sequence of change operations that should not be interrupted by normalization. For example:

```js
editor.withoutNormalizing(() => {
  node.nodes.filter(n => n.object != 'block').forEach(child => {
    editor.removeNodeByKey(child.key)
  })
})
```

### `withoutSaving`

`withoutSaving(fn: Function) => Editor`

By default all new operations are saved to the editor's history. If you have changes that you don't want to show up in the history when the user presses <kbd>cmd+z</kbd>, you can use `withoutSaving` to skip those changes.

```js
editor.withoutSaving(() => {
  editor.setDecorations(decorations)
})
```

However, be sure you know what you are doing because this will create changes that cannot be undone by the user, and might result in confusing behaviors.

### `withoutMerging`

`withoutMerging(fn: Function) => Editor`

Usually, all of the operations in a `Change` are grouped into a single save point in the editor's history. However, sometimes you may want more control over this, to be able to create distinct save points in a single change. To do that, you can use the `withoutMerging` helper.
