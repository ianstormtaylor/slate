# Value

```javascript
import { Value } from 'slate'
```

A `Value` is the top-level representation of data in Slate, containing both a [`Document`](document.md) and a selection [`Range`](range.md). It's what you need to pass into the Slate [`<Editor>`](../slate-react/editor.md) to render something onto the page.

All changes to the document and selection are also performed through the value object, so that they can stay in sync, and be propagated to its internal history of undo/redo value.

For convenience, in addition to changes, many of the selection and document properties are exposed as proxies on the `Value` object.

## Properties

```javascript
Value({
  document: Document,
  selection: Range,
  history: History,
  schema: Schema,
  data: Data,
  decorations: List<Ranges>|Null,
})
```

### `data`

`Data`

An object containing arbitrary data for the value.

### `decorations`

`List<Ranges>|Null`

A list of ranges in the document with marks that aren't part of the content itselfâ€”like matches for the current search string.

### `document`

`Document`

The current document of the value.

### `history`

`History`

An object that stores the history of changes.

### `object`

`String`

A string with a value of `'value'`.

### `schema`

`Schema`

An object representing the schema of the value's document.

### `selection`

`Range`

The current selection of the value.

## Computed Properties

These properties aren't supplied when creating a `Value`, but are instead computed based on the current `document` and `selection`.

### `{edge}Text`

`Text`

Get the leaf [`Text`](text.md) node at `{edge}`. Where `{edge}` is one of: `anchor`, `focus`, `start` or `end`.

### `{edge}Block`

`Block`

Get the leaf [`Block`](block.md) node at `{edge}`. Where `{edge}` is one of: `anchor`, `focus`, `start` or `end`.

### `marks`

`Set`

Get a set of the [`Marks`](mark.md) in the current selection.

### `activeMarks`

`Set`

Get a subset of the [`Marks`](mark.md) that are present in _all_ the characters in the current selection. It can be used to determine the active/inactive state of toolbar buttons corresponding to marks, based on the usual rich text editing conventions.

### `blocks`

`List`

Get a list of the lowest-depth [`Block`](block.md) nodes in the current selection.

### `fragment`

`Document`

Get a [`Document`](document.md) fragment of the current selection.

### `inlines`

`List`

Get a list of the lowest-depth [`Inline`](inline.md) nodes in the current selection.

### `texts`

`List`

Get a list of the [`Text`](text.md) nodes in the current selection.

### `characters`

`List`

Get a list of the [`Character`](character.md) objects in the current selection.

### `hasUndos`

`Boolean`

Whether there are undoable snapshots to revert to in the history.

### `hasRedos`

`Boolean`

Whether there are redoable snapshots to revert to in the history.

## Range-like Properties

These properties are exact proxies of the selection [`Range`](range.md) equivalents.

### `{edge}Key`

`String`

Get the current key at an `{edge}`. Where `{edge}` is one of: `anchor`, `focus`, `start` or `end`.

### `{edge}Offset`

`Number`

Get the current offset at an `{edge}`. Where `{edge}` is one of: `anchor`, `focus`, `start` or `end`.

### `isBackward`

`Boolean`

Whether the current selection is backward.

### `isBlurred`

`Boolean`

Whether the current selection is blurred.

### `isCollapsed`

`Boolean`

Whether the current selection is collapsed.

### `isExpanded`

`Boolean`

Whether the current selection is expanded.

### `isFocused`

`Boolean`

Whether the current selection is focused.

### `isForward`

`Boolean`

Whether the current selection is forward.

### `isEmpty`

`Boolean`

Whether the current selection is empty.

## Static Methods

### `Value.create`

`Value.create(properties: Object) => Value`

Create a new `Value` instance with `properties`.

### `Value.fromJSON`

`Value.fromJSON(object: Object) => Value`

Create a value from a JSON `object`.

### `Value.isValue`

`Value.isValue(any: Any) => Boolean`

Returns a boolean if the passed in argument is a `Value`.

## Instance Methods

### `change`

`change() => Change`

Create a new [`Change`](change.md) that acts on the current value.

### `toJSON`

`toJSON() => Object`

Returns a JSON representation of the value.
