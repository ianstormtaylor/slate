<!-- 
If you have a question, ask it in our Slack channel instead:

#### What's the current behavior?

<!-- 
For bugs, please include the following: 

  - A JSFiddle that reproduces the issue.
  - A GIF showing how to easily reproduce it.
  - Information about your OS, browser, Slate version, etc.

If you don't include these helpful things, there's a very good chance your issue won't get addressed, or will be closed when we do spring cleaning. 

We need to keep the issues actionable, or else maintaining Slate becomes overwhelming. Thank you for understanding!

Slate is solving a pretty complex problem, and we can't do it without active contributors. Thank you so much for your help!
