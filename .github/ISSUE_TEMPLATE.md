#### Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?

<!-- 
If you have a question, ask it in our Slack channel instead:

-->

#### What's the current behavior?

<!-- 
For bugs, you **must** include the following: 

  - A JSFiddle that minimally reproduces the issue.
  - A GIF showing the issue in action.
  - Information about your OS, browser, Slate version, etc.

If you don't include these, there's a very good chance your issue will be closed, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.

We need to keep the issues actionable, or else maintaining Slate becomes overwhelming. Thank you for understanding!

#### What's the expected behavior?

<!-- 
The fastest, and most appreciated way to have your issue fixed is to create a pull request with working, tested code and we will help get it merged. Don't be scared to open a pull request that isn't completed and ask for input. We're happy to give direction! Also, researching how other editors handle this issue is super helpful.

Slate is solving a pretty complex problem, and we can't do it without active contributors, so thank you so much for your help!
