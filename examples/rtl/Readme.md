# Right-to-Left Example

This example shows how Slate automatically detects and handles right-to-left text editing (like in Arabic, Hebrew, etc.).

Bonus: Features poetry from Khalil Gibran, from his book [The Prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_(book)).

Check out the [Examples readme](..) to see how to run it!
