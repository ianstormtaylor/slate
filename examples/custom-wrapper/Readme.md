# Rich Text Example

![](../../docs/images/rich-text-example.png)

This example shows the RichText example - but with a custom component passed in, to act as the container element for the editor.

This allows the editor to be mounted inside elements such as a <p> without causing DOM violations.

Check out the [Examples readme](..) to see how to run it!
