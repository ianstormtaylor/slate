This package contains the core logic of Slate. It's separated further into a series of directories:

* [**Changes**](./src/changes) — containing the changes that are used to alter a Slate document.
* [**Constants**](./src/constants) — containing constants that are used in Slate's codebase.
* [**Models**](./src/models) — containing the models that define Slate's data structure.
* [**Operations**](./src/operations) — containing the low-level operations that create Slate changes.
* [**Schemas**](./src/schemas) - containing the core schema that ships with Slate by default.
* [**Utils**](./src/utils) — containing a few private convenience modules.

Feel free to poke around in each of them to learn more!
