### Minor Changes

- [`c6002024`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/commit/c60020244b9d25094edb0ffcca8b49dead9b31dc) - **Updated `Text.equals` to deeply compare text node properties.** Previously it only did a shallow comparison, but this made it harder to keep track of more complex data structures at the text level.

* [#4154](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/pull/4154) [`7283c51f`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/commit/7283c51feb83cb8522bc16efce09bb01c29400b9) Thanks [@ianstormtaylor](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor)! - **Start using [ðŸ¦‹ Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to manage releases.** Going forward, whenever a pull request is made that fixes or adds functionality to Slate, it will need to be accompanied by a changset Markdown file describing the change. These files will be automatically used in the release process when bump the versions of Slate and compiling the changelog.

- [`c6002024`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/commit/c60020244b9d25094edb0ffcca8b49dead9b31dc) - **Added support for custom selection properties.** Previously you could set custom properties on the selection objects but it was not a fully supported feature because there was no way to delete them later. Now custom properties are officially supported and deleting them once set is possible.

* [`c6002024`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/commit/c60020244b9d25094edb0ffcca8b49dead9b31dc) - Added memoization logic to `Node.isNodeList` and `Editor.isEditor` to speed up common code paths.

- [`c6002024`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/commit/c60020244b9d25094edb0ffcca8b49dead9b31dc) - Fixed a bug in `Editor.positions` which caused it to sometimes skip positions in text nodes that were segmented across inlines or marks.
