This package contains the React-specific logic for Slate. It's separated further into a series of directories:

* [**Components**](./src/components) — containing the React components for rendering Slate editors.
* [**Constants**](./src/constants) — containing a few private constants modules.
* [**Plugins**](./src/plugins) — containing the React-specific plugins for Slate editors.
* [**Utils**](./src/utils) — containing a few private convenience modules.

Feel free to poke around in each of them to learn more!
