# `slate-react`

This package contains Slate's React-specific logic. It's made up of:

- [**Components**](./src/components) — containing the React components Slate renders.
- [**Constants**](./src/constants) — containing constants that are used in Slate's codebase.
- [**Plugins**](./src/plugins) — containing the core plugin that ships with Slate by default.
- [**Utils**](./src/utils) — containing a few helper modules.

Feel free to poke around in each of them to learn more!
