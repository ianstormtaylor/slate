# Changelog

This document maintains a list of changes to the `slate-base64-serializer` package with each new version. Until `1.0.0` is released, breaking changes will be added as minor version bumps, and smaller changes won't be accounted for since the library is moving quickly.

### `0.2.0` — October 27, 2017

###### BREAKING

**Updated to work with `slate@0.29.0`.** This is required because `slate-base64-serializer` needs access to the new `Value` model.

### `0.1.0` — September 17, 2017
