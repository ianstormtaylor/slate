This directory contains all of the tests for Slate. It's separated further into a series of directories:

- [**Behavior**](./behavior) — testing user interaction behaviors like pressing keys, or blurring the editor.
- [**Benchmarks**](./benchmarks) — testing performance of various parts of Slate.
- [**Helpers**](./helpers) — a series of test helper utilities to make writing tests easier.
- [**Rendering**](./rendering) — testing the rendering logic of Slate's components.
- [**Schema**](./schema) — testing the core schema validation logic.
- [**Serializers**](./serializers) - testing the serializers that Slate ships with by default.
- [**Transforms**](./transforms) — testing the transforms that change the content of a Slate editor.

Feel free to poke around in each of them to see how they work!
